# Abstract
Presentation of myself and Project Idea Description
My name is Giacomo Colosio, i'm a student of the BSc in Artificial intelligence divided between one of the most historical and important university of my country. As a machine learning researcher, I decided to test myself right away on a project that might already have a possible real-world application, specifically in the world of venture capital (VC), a form of private equity and a type of financing that investors provide to startups and small businesses that are believed to have long-term growth potential.

# Dataset : Startup Success Prediction
A startup or start-up is a company or project begun by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable economic model. While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered, startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. Startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential. Some startups become unicorns: privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. Startups play a major role in economic growth. They bring new ideas, spur innovation, create employment thereby moving the economy. There has been an exponential growth in startups over the past few years. Predicting the success of a startup allows investors to find companies that have the potential for rapid growth, thereby allowing them to be one step ahead of the competition.

# Goal of the project
The goals of the project is: Predicting the possibility of success or failure of a startup using different combinations of transformers and estimators, bringing special attention to the big elephant in the room of machine learning projects, the overfitting.
